NOTES:

Consider building iterative graphs. 
Mostly user controlled, but when a new node is added, it is placed intelligently.
Moving nodes shouldn't affect other nodes.

GOALS:

+ Be able to add any number of nodes at a time.
+ Be able to lock or free any node.
+ Parents contain children well
+ Consistency!
+ Beauty


STRATEGY:

1. Find a well-defined partitional ordering of nodes
	- linear algebra approach
	- class breaking approach
	- swapping approach


TODO:


TODO LATER:
+ fix drag
+ edges
+ prioritize sort by key, then value
	- both group members and ins
+ have a contents part above the children part
+ allow keys other than ints
+ don't repeatedly sort inSet keys
+ collapsible groups
