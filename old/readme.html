				Welcome to my site!

				<br><br>

				I'm Alex, a college student who's usually busy studying applied math and computer science, but I try to fit in some time for personal projects as well. I've gathered some of my more interactive projects here, but many of my less user friendly experiments didn't make the cut.

				<h2>Me</h2>

				<br>

				I'm super interested in all forms of computation and intelligence, and one of my life goals is to help make "a smarter human." We might do this by augmenting human brains, growing novel forms of intelligence, improving the world's education system, or maybe all three. I also rock climb, play guitar, and philosophize way too much.
