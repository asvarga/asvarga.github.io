title: Note Taking
---

I've tried a lot of note taking tools, but the only thing that works for me is simple directories of [MarkDown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files + [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version control. In fact, this website is made with these simple tools.

Here's a template: https://github.com/asvarga/MkDocs-Template

## Benefits

- Free
- Highly Portable: minimal lock-in/dependency on tools/formats
- Version Control: they're just files/directories
- Great Tooling
- Customizable/Scriptable

## Tools

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/): General Editing
    - [Foam](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foam.foam-vscode): Wikis
    - [Marp](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode): Simple Slideshows

    - [EZLinks](https://github.com/orbikm/mkdocs-ezlinks-plugin): WikiLinks
    - [More Plugins](https://github.com/mkdocs/catalog)

Altogether, I'm able to edit files and publish them to this website all from my phone.
